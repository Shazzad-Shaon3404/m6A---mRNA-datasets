# m6Am---mRNA-datasets

this data containes A C T G but for mRNA, you need to pre process this data 
we know  DNA molecule: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T) = ACTG
RNA = Adenine (A), Cytosine (C), Guanine (G), and Uracil (U) = ACUG

so you have to rpelace this data T to U


positve and negative TEST and negative TRAIN file have been collected from "m6Aminer" paper
Negative  train file has been constructed by us 
where we have used : BIOpython Pandas 
using BALANCING method: RANDOMSAMPLER 

sequence target : 3700 

all the file are now balancing  in test file : 3700 train file : 3700
